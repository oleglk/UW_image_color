+ Support settings files in separate directory
+- per-converter SETTINGS_DIR variable: "" means settings alongside RAWs, non-empty string means subdirectory under work-area, for settings of both wb-targets and ultimate photos
--- infrastructure for dependence of SETTINGS_DIR on the OS - read OS ID and array of paths
++ ensure settings always taken from the relevant place
++ Make Find*Settings*() search for matching RAWs and deduce the type from the dir where the RAWs found
+++ but use the old FindSettingsFiles() for the tests - to enable finding settings without RAWs
++ (done, not checked) don't hide unmatched settings for converters that keep settings in separate directory
++ in the tests override non-empty SETTINGS_DIR to protect real converter's directory
++ BringOneFile() should support copying settings into the standard directory
-- Write an utility to copy/move settings files from converter's standard dir to the directory of their RAWs
--- Inputs: converter name and ROOT destination directory
--- All settings files in the range between the smallest and the largest RAW name in the specified ROOT directory
--- Choice of copy or move
--- Full clean of the standard settings directory feature
- Support CaptureOne Express raw-converter
-- follow CaptureOne releases - wait for WB range increase
-- Check existence of std settings dir; ?at choosing cnv?
+ In _Unmatched test check that settings files not hidden for converters with standard settings directory - call this check alongside calls to VerifyUnmatchedInputsAreHidden
+ In _Unmatched test don't check for hidden settings  for converters with standard settings directory - code of VerifyUnmatchedInputsAreHidden
+ Add to _Unmatched test scenario of missing settings for gray-target and photo - should cause abort
++ when hiding inputs, build the list of renamed files; this way it works for standard settings dir too
++ let the action fail
++ restore (rename back) the hidden files and let the action pass
+ Complete VerifyUnmatchedInputsAreHidden
+ In case of standard settings directory, instead of VerifyUnmatchedInputsAreHidden, call VerifyNoInputsAreHidden 
+ Checkbox for debug-print in preferences
++ Put it in the row of save/cancel buttons
+ Verify/fix row and column weights in Preferences-window
- Proxies for variables in Preferences-window where needed - to preserve old state if "Cancel" pressed
- In CSV file reader compare num fields before discard-empty
